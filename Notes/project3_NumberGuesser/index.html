    <h1>Welcome to the Number Guessing Game</h1>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Guess a number between 1 and 100. If you guess too high, we will tell you
      to guess a lower number. <br />
      If you guess too low, we will tell you to guess a higher number. <br />
      Once you guess correctly, we will let you know and display how many
      guesses it took.
